**Genetic Algorithm for the Circle Packing Problem**

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of a genetic algorithm (GA) using Processing designed to address the circle packing problem. The goal of this algorithm is to optimize the arrangement of irregularly sized circles within a confined circular container such that the circles do not overlap and space utilization is maximized.

The program also includes a random and greedy algorithm, for comparison on the efficiency of the algorithms. Included within the .zip file is a report submitted to Northumbria University for the results of this program and module. Additionally, a .xlsx file is included containing the outputs and some diagrams from the results exported by this program.

**Circle Packing Problem**
From Wikipedia, "Circle packing is the study of the arrangement of circles (of equal or varying sizes) on a given surface such that no overlapping occurs and so that no circle can be enlarged without creating an overlap. The associated packing density, Î·, of an arrangement is the proportion of the surface covered by the circles."

**Features**

- Genetic Algorithm Framework: Implements crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation functions tailored for the circle packing problem.

- Tournament Selection: Utilizes a robust tournament selection mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation during evolution.

- Visualization: Includes tools to visualize circle packing solutions, making it easier to evaluate results.

- Configurable Parameters: Easily adjust parameters such as population size, mutation rate, and number of generations.

Use the Up and Down arrow keys to switch algorithms in the order;
Random -> Genetic -> Greedy
When on Random, pressing the down arrow will refresh the algorithm and provide a new random solution

Use the Left and Right arrow keys to switch between problems.

**DISCLAIMER**
Genetic Algorithms can be lengthy and resource intensive, and as such, results may vary in relation to time taken. If the program becomes unresponsive during a GA test, please understand it has not crashed, and is running in the background for a solution. More complex problems may take a great deal of time (ie minutes, or upward of an hour for the more complex cases)

To close the algorithm, stop it within the Processing UI, and run it again.
